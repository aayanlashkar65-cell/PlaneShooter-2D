✈️ Plane Shooter 2D

Plane Shooter 2D is a top-down arcade shooter developed using Unity.
In this game, the player controls a fighter plane, avoids enemy bullets, collects coins, and survives against continuous enemy attacks.

This project was developed as my second completed Unity game to improve my gameplay programming, UI systems, collision handling, and mobile build experience.
